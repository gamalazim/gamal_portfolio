# Data Science Portfolio
Gamal Abdel-Azim

A collection of data science projects that I am working on. Four projects are shown here:

  1. Data and database components: how I handle data sets going in projects
  2. Regressors (predicting values): demand forecasting 
  3. Pattern recognition and identifying health conditions
  4. A binary classifier along with feature engineering
